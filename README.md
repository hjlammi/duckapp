## Duckapp

An assignment given by Vincit for applying for a summer job in their company (http://www.koodarijahti.fi/). It is a web application build with React.js and Material-UI (http://www.material-ui.com/#/) in which you can report duck sightings and browse a list of all the reported sightings.

The backend was provided by Vincit (https://github.com/Vincit/summer-2018).

You can view the application at: https://people.uta.fi/~hl424546/duckapp/
